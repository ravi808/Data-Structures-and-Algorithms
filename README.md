# Data Structures and Algorithms

Data structures are the core of real world projects. Efficient data structures form the basis for designing efficient algorithms and software. This this course covers in depth implementations and applications of various important and interesting data structures and algorithms.



## Course Objectives

By joining this course you will learn: 

```
  1. Assess how the choice of data structures and algorithm design methods impacts the performance of programs.
  2. Choose the appropriate data structure and algorithm design method for a specified application.
  3. Write programs using object-oriented design principles.
  4. Solve problems using data structures such as linear lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, binary trees, heaps
     and tournament trees, binary search trees, and graphs and writing programs for these solutions.
  5. Solve problems using algorithm design methods such as the greedy method, divide and conquer, dynamic programming,
     backtracking, and branch and bound and writing programs for these solutions.  
```
